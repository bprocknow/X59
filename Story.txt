On a cold brisk morning in Madison Wisconsin Jimmy awoke to find the ground
 covered in a blanket of snow.  Jimmy ran outside and started to build
 a snowman.  He rolled and rolled and rolled the snow until a snowman
 stood 6 feet tall.  Although thinking about it now Jimmy was only
 four foor three so he must have grabbed a ladder or something.  When the 
snowman was completed he began putting a scarf, jacket, carrot nose and button
eyes.  When he set the tophat on the snowman came sprouted two legs and rose 
up standing over ten feet tall.  

The great heap of animate snow convulsing before Jimmy's eyes, having now gained consciousness, found that it was completely blind. While button eyes are an excellent novelty for childrens' snow endeavours, they generally don't offer much in the way of optic functionality. What the snow-being did find, however, was that it was made of snow. Unfortunately for Jimmy, much of the surface of the surrounding neighborhood was also, at the moment, made of snow. The top hat, it would seem, did not distinguish between the body of Jimmy's Frankenstein's-monster-esque creation and the rest of the raw components surrounding it, which is why Jimmy suddenly found himself on the ground which, to that point, had not been trembling with the friction of a thousand tons of shifting ice. The gelid mass, while unable to see or hear or smell, began to locomote itself towards the towers of UW Madison.
