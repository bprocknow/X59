On a cold brisk morning in Madison Wisconsin Jimmy awoke to find the ground
 covered in a blanket of snow.  Jimmy ran outside and started to build
 a snowman.  He rolled and rolled and rolled the snow until a snowman
 stood 6 feet tall.  Although thinking about it now Jimmy was only
 four foor three so he must have grabbed a ladder or something.  When the 
snowman was completed he began putting a scarf, jacket, carrot nose and button
eyes.  When he set the tophat on the snowman came sprouted two legs and rose 
up standing over ten feet tall.
